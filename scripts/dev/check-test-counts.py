"""Fail when a module ran fewer unit tests than its floor.

A suite whose tests silently stop running still passes: on 2026-10-05 every JUnit 4 and
Robolectric test in :manager was skipped for want of the vintage engine and the build was
green. Run after the unit-test tasks (CI does); raise a floor when tests are added, lower it
only on purpose when tests are removed.
