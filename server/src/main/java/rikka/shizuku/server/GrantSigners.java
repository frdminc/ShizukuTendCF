/**
 * Decides whether a persisted grant still belongs to the app that earned it. A config entry is
 * keyed by UID and its package names; a package name alone says nothing about who signed the
 * package, so after an uninstall and a reboot a same-named app signed by someone else on the same
 * UID would inherit the grant. The entry therefore records the SHA-256 digests of the signing
 * certificates seen when it was granted, and server start-up revokes it when the installed
 * package set no longer shares one of them.
 *
 * <p>Only a positive mismatch revokes: a signer read that failed or was incomplete is "unknown"
 * and keeps the grant, the same rule {@link UidPackages} applies to a package list that could not
 * be read. An entry written before digests were recorded has nothing to compare and is given the
 * current ones (trust on first reconcile).
